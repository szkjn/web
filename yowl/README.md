## GENERAL :

- Decentralised comments on reposts from any website
- An incentivised active community

YOWL is a web application that will allow users to comment on all of the content found on the Internet. Each comment will be shared by the entire YOWL user community.

Our tool will make it possible to decentralize comments from social networks and to have a new vision of the web through participatory on sources (OSINT) or simply by adding a comment thus federating communities around websites.

### Content making :

- Share content from another website : you're an owl, we need your eyes !
- Comment on a post : you're a parrot, we need your voice !

## Main Features (user) :

- Create / edit / delete a profile
- Create / edit / delete a post

## Main Features (admin) :

## Upcoming Features :

The website will ***incentivised content making*** through rewards :

- the ***owl*** who spots content and shares it with the comuunity* will be awarded badges depending on :

        1. total amount of posts (for e.g : 1 badge after 10 posts, another badge after 50 posts, etc)
        2. total amount of up-votes
        3. total amount of comments
        4. amount of up-votes on a single post
